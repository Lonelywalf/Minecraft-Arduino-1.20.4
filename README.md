# ArduinoCraft
A mod that converts a redstone signal into Arduino's ```digitalWrite()```.
## Current feature(s)
- A block called "Arduino Block" which takes redstone signals and converts it to ```digitalWrite()```

### Upcoming features
- Reading signals from Arduino's ```digitalRead()``` and convert it to redstone signals
- Menu to select the Arduino pin to your desire
## How to use
Place down the Arduino Block (from the redstone creative menu), plug in your Arduino and run the command ```/arduino start <arduino port>```. After that you can connect redstone to it and do whatever you want
