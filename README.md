# ArduinoCraft
A mod that converts a redstone signal into Arduino's ```digitalWrite()```.

## Feature(s)
Currently nothing works yet but I am planning to do this:
- A block called "Arduino Block" which takes redstone signals and converts it to ```digitalWrite()```

### Upcoming features
- Reading signals from arduino ```digitalRead()``` and convert it to redstone signals
